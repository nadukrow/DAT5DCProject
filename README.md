# Project Proposal: Can salary allocation affect a NBA franchise's chances for success?
4/6/2015

While the NBA has been a star driven league for decades, it is and always will be a team oriented sport. Players like Carmelo Anthony, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, and James Harden are seen as the best and therefore are paid like so. There have been teams constructed that look to pay 2-3 exceptional players and have less money for the rest of the roster as well as the bench. Then you have teams that look to allocate their funds in a way that doesn't leave them less money for role players. 

The question I want to answer is how likely an NBA team will succeed in winning the NBA finals based on how they allocated their contracts to players.

The data I plan to use to answer the question is located at http://www.basketball-reference.com/
Here I'll be able to track the salaries of the winning teams and how they allocated their funds. I'll continue to search for other websites that may be helpful in looking and exploring the data.
